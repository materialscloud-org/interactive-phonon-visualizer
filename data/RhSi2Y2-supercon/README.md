This data is taken from the MC3D pbesol-v1 superconductivity contribution.

```python
matdyn_retrieved_uuid = "4d458ee8-79e6-4939-92bf-ff6540cd0f56"
pw_workchain_uuid = "9be2414a-1d4b-47b5-9a26-8ae3a86f07eb"
```

The Q-point labels were taken from the associated phonon bandstructure calculation.

Note that the automatic seekpath label generation doesn't work in this case (probably due to a different symprec).
